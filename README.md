This repo was forked from [mikeshulman/basictex](https://github.com/mikeshulman/basictex).

This repo contains
* decls.tex: the basic LaTeX macros that I use in all my papers
* paper.tex: a sample LaTeX file for the paper itself
* slides.tex: a similar sample file for making beamer slides
* all.bib: a symlink to `../cites/all.bib`
* Makefile: used to compile, clean, and setup the repo

I maintain my bibtex database in a separate repo.
