Everything written here is based on my current (limited) knowledge of categorical logic.
Some content written herein is purely my own speculation and is by no means authoritative.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The categorification of algebraic theories allow us to study them in a presentation-independent way.
Algebraic theories are precisely categories with finite products.
We think of the objects of such a category as sorts and morphisms as terms.
Identities and composition correspond to variables and substitution, respectively.
Equations are internalized as the diagonal subobject.
Given two algebraic theories $\cT$ and $\cT'$, a model of $\cT$ in $\cT'$ is a finite-product preserving functor $M : \cT \to \cT'$.
This ensures that products of sorts in $\cT$ are interpreted (sensibly) as products of sorts in $\cT'$.
Moreover, this ensures that equations are preserved.
Then, a homomorphism from $M$ to $M'$ is precisely a natural transformation $\alpha : M \To M'$.

Category with finite products, finite-product preserving functors, and natural transformations form the doctrine of algebraic theories $\CAlg$.
The slice $\CAlg/\CSet$ recovers the classical set-theoretic models.
Explicitly, this slice has set-theoretic models, compatible theory morphisms, and natural transformations between them.
In fact, for any algebraic theory $\cT$, the hom-category $\CAlg(\cT,\CSet)$, i.e., the category of set-theoretic models, is equivalent to a cocomplete category with a strong generator comprised of perfectly presentable objects.

We can generalize this viewpoint: theories can be internalized in a sufficiently structured category.
Then a model of a theory in another theory is a functor preserving those structures.
The goal of this writeup is to develop this idea in more detail.
