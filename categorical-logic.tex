\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The categorification of algebraic theories allow us to study them in a presentation-independent way.
Algebraic theories are precisely categories with finite products.
We think of the objects of such a category as sorts and morphisms as terms.
Identities and composition correspond to variables and substitution, respectively.
Equations are internalized as the diagonal subobject.
Given two algebraic theories $\cT$ and $\cT'$, a model of $\cT$ in $\cT'$ is a finite-product preserving functor $M : \cT \to \cT'$.
This ensures that products of sorts in $\cT$ are interpreted (sensibly) as products of sorts in $\cT'$.
Moreover, this ensures that equations are preserved.
Then, a homomorphism from $M$ to $M'$ is precisely a natural transformation $\alpha : M \To M'$.

Category with finite products, finite-product preserving functors, and natural transformations form the doctrine of algebraic theories $\CAlg$.
The slice $\CAlg/\CSet$ recovers the classical set-theoretic models.
Explicitly, this slice has set-theoretic models, compatible theory morphisms, and natural transformations between them.
In fact, for any algebraic theory $\cT$, the hom-category $\CAlg(\cT,\CSet)$, i.e., the category of set-theoretic models, is equivalent to a cocomplete category with a strong generator comprised of perfectly presentable objects.

We can generalize this viewpoint: theories can be internalized in a sufficiently structured category.
Then a model of a theory in another theory is a functor preserving those structures.
The goal of this writeup is to develop this idea in more detail.

\section{Hyperdoctrine}
\label{sec:hyperdoctrine}

A theory in propositional logic is a Heyting (or Boolean) algebra.
Each sort of the theory is equipped with a poset of propositions, in which $\varphi \leq \psi$ means $\varphi$ entails $\psi$.
For simplicity, let us assume a single sorted theory with no function symbols.
Let us recall Tarski's definition:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The unique sort is a set $S$.
\item A proposition variable is a subset of $S$.
\item $\top$ is the entire set $S$.
\item $\bot$ is the empty set $\varnothing$.
\item $\varphi \wedge \psi$ is the intersection $\varphi \cap \psi$.
\item $\varphi \vee \psi$ is the union $\varphi \cup \psi$.
\item $\varphi \To \psi$ is the exponential $\psi^{\varphi}$, i.e., the largest element so that $\psi^{\varphi} \wedge \varphi \leq \psi$.
\end{enumerate}

Essentially, propositions live in a poset with sufficient structure: various logical connectives correspond to various universal constructions.
As a model of a theory $\cT$ in another theory $\cT'$ has to preserve entailment, we expect it to be a function $M : \cT \to \cT'$ preserving relevant structures.

Generalizing this to multisorted theories is straightforward.
Each sort of the theory has a poset of propositions.
In the presence of nontrivial terms, we need to specify how propositions in context interact with substitutions.
For example, given a proposition in the context $d$, i.e., $\vdash_{d} \varphi$, substitution by a term $f : c \to d$ ought to produce a proposition in the context $c$, i.e., $\vdash_{c} \varphi[f]$.
Of course, we expect substitution to satisfy $\varphi[f][g] = \varphi[g \circ f]$ and $\varphi[\id] = \varphi$.

\begin{defn}
  A \emph{doctrine} is a functor $\cC : \iC\op \to \CPos$, where $\CPos$ is some suitable category of posets.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\label{def:model-of-doctrine}
  A \emph{model} of a doctrine $\cC : \iC\op \to \CPos$ in another doctrine $\cD : \iD\op \to \CPos$ consists of
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A model $M : \iC \to \iD$.
  \item A natural transformation $\lambda : \cC \To \cD \circ M\op$.
  \end{itemize}

      \arrow["\lambda"{description}, shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt, Rightarrow, from=0, to=1-3]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
\end{defn}

Let us unpack \cref{def:model-of-doctrine}.
The model $M : \iC \to \iD$ is unsurprising: we need to express $\iC$ in terms of $\iD$.
Each component $\lambda_{c}$ is a model of propositions $\cC(c)$ in $\cD M\op(c)$.
Naturality expresses that these models are compatible with substitutions.

    \arrow["{\lambda_{c'}}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
  \end{tikzcd}\]

Quantifiers can be characterized as adjoints, too.
Given a term $f : c \to d$, the formula $\exists_{f}\varphi$ ought to be the smallest formula so that $\varphi \leq (\exists_{f}\varphi)[f]$.
Similarly, the formula $\forall_{f}\varphi$ ought to be the largest formula so that $(\forall_{f}\varphi)[f] \leq \varphi$.
That is, we need the following adjoints:

    \arrow["\dashv"{anchor=center}, draw=none, from=0, to=2]
  \end{tikzcd}\]
Indeed, in the powerset doctrine $\cP : \CSet\op \to \CPos$, the existential quantifier and the universal quantifier are given by the direct image $f_{*}$ and the fiber image $f_{!}$, respectively.
