\begin{thm}[Monadicity Theorem]\label{thm:monadicity-theorem}
  A right adjoint $U : \iD \to \iC$ is monadic if and only if it creates coequalizers of $U$-split pairs.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  We have already proved the ``if'' direction.
  For the ``only if'' direction, assume that $U$ creates coequalizers of $U$-split pairs.
  Our goal is to construct an inverse equivalence $L$ for the canonical comparison functor $K : \iD \to \iC^{T}$.

  For free algebras, we define $L(TA,\mu_{A}) = FA$ and $Lf = Ff$.
  For any algebra $(A, \alpha)$, note that
  \input{img/5-01}
  is a $U$-split pair in $\iC$.
  Since $U$ creates coequalizers of this kind, define $L(A,\alpha)$ to be the coequalizer in $\iD$:
  \input{img/5-02}
  For any $T$-homomorphism $f : (A, \alpha) \to (B, \beta)$, define $Lf$ as the unique map given by the universal property of coequalizer:
  \input{img/5-03}
  Uniqueness implies functoriality.

  It remains to check that $L$ defines an inverse equivalence of $K$.
  \input{img/5-04}
  $L$ carries the right-hand parallel pair to the parallel pair on the left.
  Then $K$ carries this parallel pair to the same parallel pair on the right.
  Since $U^{T}$ strictly creates coequalizers of $U^{T}$-split pairs, $KL \iso \id_{\iC^{T}}$.

  Now, since $U$ creates coequalizers of $U$-split pairs, the top diagram is a coequalizer diagram.
  $LKD$ is defined to be the coequalizer of the parallel pair in the diagram.
  \input{img/5-05}
  The isomorphism $LKD \iso D$ for each $D$ assembles into a natural isomorphism $LK \iso \id_{\iD}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
  A functor is \emph{finitary} if it preserves filtered colimits.
  Any finitary right adjoint induces a \emph{finitary monad} since left adjoints preserve any colimit.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  A pair of parallel morphisms $f,g : x \toto y$ is \emph{reflexive} if both morphisms admit a common section.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
  Conservative functors $U : \iD \to \iC$ reflect all limits and colimits that exist in $\iD$ and $U$ preserves.
\end{lem}

\begin{thm}[Reflexive Tripleability Theorem]
  If $U : \iD \to \iC$ admits a left adjoint and if
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\iD$ has coequalizers of reflexive pairs;
  \item $U$ preserves coequalizers of reflexive pairs;
  \item $U$ reflects isomorphisms,
  \end{enumerate}
  then $U$ is monadic.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  By \cref{thm:monadicity-theorem}, it suffices to prove that $U$ creates coequalizers of $U$-split pairs.
\end{proof}
