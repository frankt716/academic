\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This section introduces a syntactic proof technique for adjoint functors, and compares this method to Yoneda-style proofs.

\begin{lem}
  If $F \dashv G$ and $F' \dashv G$, then $F \iso F'$ and there is a unique $\theta : F \iso F'$ commuting with the units and counits of the adjunction.
  \begin{mathpar}
    \input{img/4-01} \and \input{img/4-02}
  \end{mathpar}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  To define a natural transformation $\theta : F \to F'$, we use the following fact
  \input{img/4-03}
  defining $\theta$ to be the transpose of $\eta'$.
  That is,
  \input{img/4-04}
  Exchanging the role of $F$ and $F'$, we define $\theta' : F' \to F$ as follows
  \input{img/4-05}

  To show that $\theta'\theta = \id_{F}$, it suffices to show that $(\theta'\theta)^{\dag} = \eta$.
  \input{img/4-06}
  By naturality in $\eta$,
  \input{img/4-07}
  By the triangle equality,
  \input{img/4-08}
  By naturality in $\eta'$,
  \input{img/4-09}
  Finally, the triangle equality yields
  \input{img/4-10}

  For the converse direction, we need to show that $\theta\theta' = \id_{F'}$.
  It is sufficient to show that $(\theta\theta')^{\dag} = \eta'$.
  \input{img/4-11}
  By naturality in $\eta'$,
  \input{img/4-12}
  By the triangle equality,
  \input{img/4-13}
  By naturality in $\eta$,
  \input{img/4-14}
  Finally, the triangle equality yields
  \input{img/4-15}
  Note that the fact that the diagram
  \input{img/4-13}
  reduces to $\eta$ means that the left-hand diagram in the statement commute.
  Furthermore, the left-hand diagram says that the transpose of $\theta$ along $F \dashv G$ is $\eta'$, which is precisely the definition of $\theta$, proving uniqueness.
  It remains to verify the right-hand diagram commutes.
  \input{img/4-16}
  By naturality in $\epsilon'$,
  \input{img/4-17}
  And by the triangle equality,
  \input{img/4-18}
\end{proof}
