\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This is my personal note for \cite{hofmann:ssdts} and \cite{awodey:natmodels}.
Categorical semantics of type theory provides abstract semantics for which a concrete mathematical model can be identified.
To develop categorical semantics, substitutions are treated as a primitive operation, rather than an inductive defined one on the pre-syntax.
Further, variables are presented as combinators for substitutions.
Additional axioms will be imposed so that substitutions work as expected.
By treating substitutions abstractly, any concrete implementation of substitution satisfying the axioms can model the abstract one.

One may ask ``what additional axioms are reasonable?''
This is the tension between abstractions and implementations.
Abstractions allow us to summarize past analytic experiences, while concrete implementations mean that the abstractions are not merely fantasies.

\section{Dependent Type Theory}
\label{sec:dependent-type-theory}
A type theory is a \emph{formal} theory with the following 6 basic forms of judgments.
\begin{mathpar}
  \Gamma \ctxt
  \and
  \Gamma = \Delta \ctxt
  \and
  A \type
  \and
  A = B \type
  \and
  a : A
  \and
  a = b : A
\end{mathpar}
The last 4 judgments can be made under a valid context, e.g., $\Gamma \vdash A \type$.
The context roughly corresponds to the content of a \emph{where} clause in English.
For example, we may say ``$\mathrm{Vec}(x)$ is a type where $x$ is a natural number.''
The \emph{inference rules} specify when a judgment can be derived given others.
For example,
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule
  { }
  { \diamond \ctxt }
  \and
  \inferrule
  { \Gamma \ctxt \\ \Gamma \vdash A \type }
  { \Gamma, x : A \ctxt }
  \and
  \inferrule
  { \Gamma, x : A \ctxt }
  { \Gamma, x : A \vdash x : A }
\end{mathpar}
These rules together with some conversion rules specify the structure of dependent type theory.
Type formers and term formers can be added.
Some quintessential examples are $\Pi$-types, $\Sigma$-types, $\Id$-types, and universes.
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule*
  { \Gamma \vdash A \type \\ \Gamma, x : A \vdash B \type }
  { \Gamma \vdash \prod_{x : A}B \type }
  \and
  \inferrule*
  { \Gamma \vdash A \type \\ \Gamma, x : A \vdash B \type }
  { \Gamma \vdash \sum_{x : A}B \type }
  \and
  \inferrule*
  { \Gamma \vdash a : A \\ \Gamma \vdash b : A }
  { \Gamma \vdash \Id(a, b) \type }
  \and
  \inferrule*
  { }
  { \Gamma \vdash \cU \type }
  \and
  \inferrule*
  { \Gamma \vdash t : \cU }
  { \Gamma \vdash \El(t) \type }
\end{mathpar}

In a model of type theory, inference rules are combinators that take the interpretations of the premises as inputs and produce the interpretation of the conclusion as an output.

\section{Substitution}
\label{sec:substitution}
Write $\Gamma \vdash A \type$ for an element $A$ of the set of semantic types under the semantic context $\Gamma$, and $\Gamma \vdash a : A$ for an element $a$ of the set of semantic terms of type $A$.
For any substitution $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$, write $\blank[\sigma]$ for the action of substitution with $\sigma$ on both types and terms.
We impose the following axioms.
\begin{mathpar}
  A[\sigma \circ \xi] = (A[\sigma])[\xi]
  \and
  a[\sigma \circ \xi] = (a[\sigma])[\xi]
  \and
  A[\id] = A
  \and
  a[\id] = a
\end{mathpar}
These equations correspond to the familiar properties of the inductively defined substitution.
\begin{mathpar}
  A[t[u/x]/x] = (A[t/x])[u/x]
  \and
  a[t[u/x]/x] = (a[t/x])[u/x]
  \and
  A[x/x] = A
  \and
  a[x/x] = a
\end{mathpar}

\section{Category with Families}
\label{sec:category-with-families}

\begin{defn}[Category of families of sets]
  The category $\iF$ of families of sets consists of
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Objects: an indexed family of sets $(I, A_{i \in I})$ where for each $i \in I$, $A_{i}$ is a set.
  \item Morphisms: a morphism $f : (I, A_{i \in I}) \to (J, B_{j \in J})$ consists of a function $f : I \to J$, and an $I$-indexed family of functions $f_{i} : A_{i} \to B_{f(i)}$.
  \end{itemize}
  Identities and compositions are defined in an obvious way.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Category with families]
  A category with families consists of
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A base category $\iC$, whose objects are called contexts and whose morphisms are called substitutions.
  \item A terminal object $\diamond \in \iC$, called the empty context.
  \item A functor $T : \iC\op \to \iF$, mapping each context $\Gamma$ to a family of sets $(\Ty(\Gamma), \Tm_{A \in \Ty(\Gamma)})$, where the set $\Ty(\Gamma)$ is the set of types in context $\Gamma$, and for each $A \in \Ty(\Gamma)$ the set $\Tm_{A}$ is the set of terms of type $A$ in context $\Gamma$.
    For each substitution $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$, $T$ induces a morphism $T(\sigma) : (\Ty(\Gamma), \Tm_{A \in \Ty(\Gamma)}) \to (\Ty(\Delta), \Tm_{A \in \Ty(\Delta)})$, which consists of a function $\blank[\sigma] : \Ty(\Gamma) \to \Ty(\Delta)$, and a family of functions $\blank[\sigma]_{A} : \Tm_{A} \to \Tm_{A[\sigma]}$.
    These functions are the substitution with $\sigma$ on types and on terms, respectively.
    We omit the subscript in the substitution on terms whenever possible.
  \item For each $\Gamma \in \iC$ and each $A \in \Ty(\Gamma)$, there is a context extension $\Gamma.A \in \iC$, a morphism $p_{A} : \Gamma.A \to \Gamma$, and a term $q_{A} \in \Tm(\Gamma.A)_{A[p_{A}]}$ with the universal property that for any $\Delta \in \iC$, any $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$, and any $a \in \Tm(\Delta)_{A[\sigma]}$, there is a unique morphism $(\sigma, a) : \Delta \to \Gamma.A$ such that $p_{A} \circ (\sigma, a) = \sigma$ and that $q_{A}[(\sigma, a)] = a$.
    \input{img/img23}
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

Any CwF $\iC$ has the structure of dependent type theory described in \S \ref{sec:dependent-type-theory}.
The terminal object $\diamond \in \iC$ models the empty context.
Context extension and its universal property model the context extension rule and the variable rule.
Additionally, substitutions satisfy the required equations.
This follows directly by functoriality.
For $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$ and $\xi : \Xi \to \Delta$, we have $T(\sigma \circ \xi) = T(\xi) \circ T(\sigma)$.
The left-hand side consists of a function $\blank[\sigma \circ \xi] : \Ty(\Gamma) \to \Ty(\Xi)$, which equals $(\blank[\sigma])[\xi]$ by the right-hand side, and a family of functions $\blank[\sigma \circ \xi]_{A} : \Tm(\Gamma) \to \Tm(\Xi)$, which equals $(\blank[\sigma]_{A[\xi]})[\xi]_{A}$ by the right-hand side.
The other two equations, $A[\id] = A$ and $a[\id] = a$, also follow by functoriality.


\subsection{Terms and Sections}
\label{sec:cwf-terms-and-sections}
Let $\Gamma \in \iC$ and $\Gamma \vdash A \type$.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of sections of $p_{A}$ and the set of terms $\Tm(\Gamma)_{A}$.
Let $\Gamma \vdash a : A$, then evidently $\Gamma \vdash a : A[\id]$.
The universal property for context extension then states that there is a unique section $(\id, a) : \Gamma \to \Gamma.A$.
\[
  \begin{array}{r@{~:~}ccc}
    \varphi & \Tm(\Gamma)_{A} & \to & \mathrm{Section}(p_{A})\\
    \varphi & a & \mapsto & (\id, a)
  \end{array}
\]
Conversely, for any section $\sigma$ of $p_{A}$, there is a term
\[
  q_{A}[\sigma] \in \Tm(\Gamma)_{(A[p_{A}])[\sigma]} = \Tm(\Gamma)_{A[p_{A} \circ \sigma]} = \Tm(\Gamma)_{A}
\]
Thus, we define
\[
  \begin{array}{r@{~:~}ccc}
    \psi & \mathrm{Section}(p_{A}) & \to & \Tm(\Gamma)_{A}\\
    \psi & \sigma & \mapsto & q_{A}[\sigma]
  \end{array}
\]
The two functions are mutual inverses by the universal property of context extension.
Thus, the set of terms of type $A$ in context $\Gamma$ can be viewed as the set of sections of the morphism $p_{A}$.
\input{img/img19}

\subsection{Weakening}
\label{sec:cwf-weakening}
Suppose that $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$ and that $\Gamma \vdash A \type$.
Then $\Delta \vdash A[\sigma] \type$.
Thus, there is a term $\Delta.A[\sigma] \vdash q_{A[\sigma]} : A[\sigma \circ p_{A[\sigma]}]$.
The universal property of context extension gives a substitution $\Delta.A[\sigma] \to \Gamma.A$ as indicated in
\input{img/img16}
We call such a substitution a weakening substitution, and denote it as $\sigma_{A}$.
In the special case where $\sigma$ is $\id_{\Gamma}$, the weakening substitution is the identity.
\input{img/img17}
And in the special case where $\sigma$ is $p_{A}$, the weakening substitution adds a new variable of type $A$ to the context.
In dependent type theory, types in a context can mention variables declared prior to it.
The operation $\blank[p_{A}]$ ``up-shifts'' the variables so that the newly added type $A$ mentions the same variables as the already existing type $A$.
\input{img/img18}

\section{Natural Model}
\label{sec:natural-model}
\begin{defn}[Natural models]
  Let $\iC$ be a small category.
  A natural transformation $\tau : \Tm \to \Ty$ between presheaves on $\iC$ is \emph{representable} when all of its fibers are representable objects in the sense that for any $\Gamma \in C$ and $A \in \Ty(\Gamma)$, we have a pullback.
  \input{img/img01}
  A \emph{natural model} of type theory is a representable natural transformation between presheaves.
  $\Tm$ is the presheaf of terms and $\Ty$ is the presheaf of types.
\end{defn}
The Yoneda Lemma identifies $A : \yon \Gamma \to \Ty$ with a type $A \in \Ty(\Gamma)$ and $b : \yon \Delta \to \Tm$ with a term $b \in \Tm(\Delta)$.
The component $\tau_{\Gamma} : \Tm(\Gamma) \to \Ty(\Gamma)$ can be thought of as the typing of terms in context $\Gamma$.
We write $\Gamma \vdash A \type$ for $A \in \Ty(\Gamma)$ and $\Gamma \vdash b : B$ for $a \in \Tm(\Gamma)$, where $B = \tau \circ b$ as indicated in
\input{img/img02}
Henceforth, we omit $\yon$ whenever possible.

For an arbitrary morphism $\sigma$ in $C$, we use the following notations for the action on morphisms of the respective presheaf.
\begin{mathpar}
  \Ty(\sigma) \iff \blank[\sigma]
  \and
  \Tm(\sigma) \iff \blank[\sigma]
\end{mathpar}
As a consequence of the Yoneda Lemma, $A[\sigma] = A \circ \yon\sigma$ and $a[\sigma] = a \circ \yon\sigma$ for any $\Gamma \vdash A \type$ and $\Gamma \vdash a : A$.

\begin{thm}
  Let $\tau : \Tm \to \Ty$ be a natural transformation of presheaves on a small category $\iC$ with a terminal object.
  Then $\tau$ is representable (a natural model of type theory) just when $(\iC, \tau)$ is a category with families.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Naturality of $\tau$ means that for any substitution $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$, the diagram
  \input{img/img03}
  commutes.
  Thus, we have that
  \begin{mathpar}
    \Gamma \vdash A \type \imp \Delta \vdash A[\sigma] \type
    \and
    \Gamma \vdash a : A \imp \Delta \vdash a[\sigma] : A[\sigma]
  \end{mathpar}
  The former is given by $\Ty(\sigma)$, and the latter is given by $\Tm(\sigma)$.
  Moreover, the latter ``type-checks'' because the diagram commutes, i.e., $A[\sigma] = (\tau_{\Gamma}(a))[\sigma] = \tau_{\Delta}(a[\sigma])$.

  By functoriality, the following equations are satisfied
  \begin{mathpar}
    A[\sigma \circ \xi] = (A[\sigma])[\xi]
    \and
    A[\id] = A
    \and
    a[\sigma \circ \xi] = (a[\sigma])[\xi]
    \and
    a[\id] = a
  \end{mathpar}
  where $\xi$ is an arbitrary substitution $\xi : \Xi \to \Delta$.
  Note that the contravariance of the presheves $\Tm$ and $\Ty$ plays a role in the order of the compositions, which works out nicely with the chosen notations.
  These data provide a canonical functor $T : \iC\op \to \iF$.
  \input{img/img15}
  As usual, $\tau_{\Delta}\inv(A) \subseteq \Tm(\Delta)$ is the fiber over $A$.
  $T(\sigma)$ consists of the function $\blank[\sigma] : \Ty(\Delta) \to \Ty(\Gamma)$ and a family of functions $\blank[\sigma]_{A} : \tau_{\Delta}\inv(A) \to \tau_{\Gamma}\inv(A[\sigma])$ defined by restricting $\blank[\sigma] : \Tm(\Delta) \to \Tm(\Gamma)$ to the fiber $\tau_{\Delta}\inv(A)$.

  The final piece of data associated with a CwF is context extension, which is encoded precisely by the representability of $\tau$.
  Given any $\Gamma \vdash A \type$, by Yoneda there is a corresponding map $A : \Gamma \to \Ty$.
  Representability of $\tau$ then means that for any $\Delta \vdash a : A[\sigma]$, we have
  \input{img/img04}
  The notations used in the diagram above is justified because $\yon$ is fully faithful.
  In particular, we have that $q \circ \yon(\sigma, a) = a$, which implies that $q_{\Delta} \circ (\sigma, a)_{*} = a_{\Delta}$.
  The component $a_{\Delta} : C(\Delta, \Delta) \to \Tm(\Delta)$ is a function.
  Thus, we have that $q_{\Delta} \circ (\sigma, a)_{*} (\id_{\Delta}) = a_{\Delta}(\id_{\Delta})$.
  By Yoneda, the left-hand side determines the element $q[(\sigma, a)] \in \Tm(\Delta)$, while the right-hand side determines the element $a \in \Tm(\Delta)$.
  Thus, we can extract the required equations from the pullback diagram.
  \begin{mathpar}
    p \circ (\sigma, a) = \sigma
    \and
    q[(\sigma, a)] = a
  \end{mathpar}
  Additionally, by uniqueness, we also have the following required equations.
  \begin{mathpar}
    (\sigma, a) \circ \xi = (\sigma \circ \xi, a[\xi])
    \and
    (p, q) = \id_{\Gamma.A}
  \end{mathpar}
  where $\xi : \Xi \to \Delta$ is an arbitrary substitution.
\end{proof}

By waving a magic wand, every natural model $f : \Tm \to \Ty$ has an associated polynomial functor $F(X) = \sum_{A : \Ty}X^{A}$ such that
\begin{mathpar}
  \mprset{
    fraction={===},
    fractionaboveskip=2.3 ex
  }
  \inferrule
  { (A, B) : \Gamma \to \sum_{A : \Ty}\Ty^{A} }
  { \Gamma \vdash A \type \\ \Gamma.A \vdash B \type }
  \and
  \inferrule
  { (A, b) : \Gamma \to \sum_{A : \Ty}\Tm^{A} }
  { \Gamma \vdash A \type \\ \Gamma.A \vdash b : B }
\end{mathpar}

\section{Type Formers}
\label{sec:type-formers}

To interpret various type formers and term formers, CwFs and natural models need to be equipped with additional operations.

\subsection{$\Pi$-Types}
\begin{defn}
  A CwF supports intensional $\Pi$-types if the following data are given
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An operator $\Pi : \Ty(\Gamma) \times \Ty(\Gamma.A) \to \Ty(\Gamma)$ such that for any $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$
    \[
      \left(\prod_{A}B\right)[\sigma] = \prod_{A[\sigma]}B[\sigma_{A}]
    \]
  \item An operator $\lambda_{A,B} : \Tm(\Gamma.A)_{B} \to \Tm(\Gamma)_{\prod_{A}B}$ such that for any $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$
    \[
      (\lambda_{A,B}b)[\sigma] = \lambda_{A[\sigma],B[\sigma_{A}]}b[\sigma_{A}]
    \]
  \item A morphism $\app_{A,B} : \Gamma.A.(\Pi_{A}B) \to \Gamma.A.B$ such that \input{img/img20} and \input{img/img25} commute.
    And for any morphism $\sigma : \Delta \to \Gamma$, \todo
    \[
      \app_{A,B} \circ \sigma_{A_{(\Pi_{A}B)[\sigma_{A}]}} = \sigma_{A_{B}} \circ \app_{A[\sigma],B[\sigma_{A}]}
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
The morphism $\app_{A,B}$ is rather mysterious.
To unravel what it means, observe that a term $\Gamma \vdash t : B[a]$ can be obtained from the variable $\Gamma.A.B \vdash q_{B} : B[p_{B}]$ with a suitable substitution.

In the elimination rule, two terms $\Gamma \vdash a : A$ and $\Gamma \vdash f : \prod_{A}B$ are given.
The idea is to take $t$ as the application of $f$ to $a$.
The universal property of context extension gives a morphism $(a, f) : \Gamma \to \Gamma.A.(\Pi_{A}B)$.
The first equation yields \input{img/img24}
Thus, there is a term $\Gamma \vdash q_{B}[\app_{A,B} \circ (a,f)] : B[a]$.

Next to validate the $\beta$-rule, the equation $\Gamma \vdash q_{B}[\app_{A,B} \circ (a,\lambda_{A,B}b)] = b[a] : B[a]$ must hold for any $\Gamma.A \vdash b : B$.
The second equation states that $\app_{A,B} \circ (a,\lambda_{A,B}b)$ is precisely $(a,b[a])$, and $q_{B}[a,b[a]] = b[a]$ follows from the universal property of context extension.

Finally, the last equation states that function application is stable under substitution.

\begin{defn}
  A CwF supports extensional $\Pi$-types if it supports intensional $\Pi$-types, and whenever $b \in \Tm(\Gamma.A)_{B}$ and $f \in \Tm(\Gamma)_{\Pi_{A}B}$ and $\app_{A,B} \circ f = b$, then $f = \lambda_{A,B}b$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
  Let $F(X) = \sum_{A : \Ty}X^{A}$ be the polynomial functor associated to a natural model $f : \Tm \to \Ty$.
  Then the type-theoretic rules for (extensional) $\Pi$-types are modeled by maps of the form
  \begin{mathpar}
    \lambda : F(\Tm) \to \Tm
    \and
    \Pi : F(\Ty) \to \Ty
  \end{mathpar}
  making the following diagram a pullback.
  \input{img/img05}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  The type-theoretic $\Pi$-formation rule is
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule
    { \Gamma \vdash A \type \\ \Gamma.A \vdash B \type }
    { \Gamma \vdash \prod_{A}B \type }
  \end{mathpar}
  The premises correspond to a map $(A, B) : \Gamma \to F(\Ty)$.
  Composing $\Pi$ with $(A, B)$ yields $\Gamma \vdash \prod_{A}B \type$.
  \input{img/img06}
  Thus, $\Pi : F(\Ty) \to \Ty$ models the type-theoretic formation rule.

  Similarly, the type-theoretic $\Pi$-introduction rule is
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule
    { \Gamma \vdash A \type \\ \Gamma.A \vdash b : B }
    { \Gamma \vdash \lambda_{A}b : \prod_{A}B }
  \end{mathpar}
  The premises correspond to a map $(A, b) : \Gamma \to F(\Tm)$, whose composition with $\lambda : F(\Tm) \to \Tm$ yields $\Gamma \vdash \lambda_{A}b : \prod_{A}B$.
  Thus, $\lambda : F(\Tm) \to \Tm$ models the type-theoretic introduction rule.
  \input{img/img07}

  Now consider the elimination rule and its associated $\beta$-rule and $\eta$-rule.
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule
    { \Gamma \vdash g : \prod_{A}B \\ \Gamma \vdash a : A }
    { \Gamma \vdash g(a) : B[a] }
    \and
    \inferrule
    { \Gamma.A \vdash b : B \\ \Gamma \vdash a : A }
    { \Gamma \vdash (\lambda_{A}b)(a) = b[a] : B[a] }
    \and
    \inferrule
    { \Gamma \vdash g : \prod_{A}B }
    { \Gamma \vdash \lambda_{A}(g[p_{A}](q_{A})) = g : \prod_{A}B }
  \end{mathpar}
  where $b[a]$ and $B[a]$ are defined respectively as
  \begin{mathpar}
    b \circ (1, a) \and B \circ (1, a)
  \end{mathpar}
  as indicated in
  \input{img/img08}
  Intuitively, $B[a]$ corresponds to the type obtained by filling in $a$ for the last variable in the context, and $b[a]$ corresponds to the term obtained by filling in $a$ for the last variable in the context.
  
  The first premise of the elimination rule states that we have a commutative diagram.
  \input{img/img09}
  By the universal property of the pullback, we then have a unique map $(A, \widetilde{g}) : \Gamma \to F(\Tm)$, corresponding to $\Gamma \vdash A \type$ and $\Gamma.A \vdash \widetilde{g} : B$.
  \input{img/img10}
  Thus, we have a term $\Gamma \vdash \widetilde{g}[a] : B[a]$, and we take $g(a) := \gtil[a]$.
  \input{img/img11}

  From the first premise of the $\beta$-rule, we can extract that
  \begin{mathpar}
    \Gamma \vdash A \type
    \and
    \Gamma.A \vdash B \type
    \and
    \Gamma.A \vdash b : B
  \end{mathpar}
  Thus, there are maps $(A, B) : \Gamma \to F(\Ty)$ and $(A, b) : \Gamma \to F(\Tm)$.
  The introduction rule gives a term $\Gamma \vdash \lambda_{A}b : B$ so that the diagram commutes.
  \input{img/img12}
  Thus, there is a unique map $(A, \widetilde{\lambda_{A}b}) : \Gamma \to F(\Tm)$.
  \input{img/img13}
  By definition, $\Gamma \vdash (\lambda_{A}b)(a) = \widetilde{\lambda_{A}b}[a] : B[a]$, where $a$ is given by the second premise.
  Additionally, $\lambda \circ (A, b) = \lambda_{A}b$.
  By uniqueness, $\Gamma.A \vdash b = \widetilde{\lambda_{A}b} : B$, yielding the desired equation: $\Gamma \vdash (\lambda_{A}b)(a) = b[a] : B[a]$.

  Finally, the $\eta$-law is also satisfied. \todo
  The premise says that there is a unique map $(A, \gtil) \maps \Gamma \to F(\Tm)$.
  \input{img/img14}
  By definition, $(g[p_{A}])(q_{A}) = \widetilde{g[p_{A}]}[q_{A}] = \widetilde{g[p_{A}]} \circ (1, q_{A})$.

  \todo
  The type and term constructors $\Pi$, $\lambda$, and $\blank(\blank)$ also respect substitutions $\sigma \maps \Delta \to \Gamma$.
  Consider the formation rule,
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule
    { \Gamma \vdash A \type \\ \Gamma.A \vdash B \type }
    { \Gamma \vdash \prod_{A}B \type }
  \end{mathpar}
  Applying $\sigma$ to each premise yields a new instance of the formation rule.

  $\Gamma.A \vdash B \type$,
  $\Delta.A[\sigma] \vdash B[\sigma] \type$
  
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule
    { \Delta \vdash A[\sigma] \type \\ \Delta.A[\sigma] \vdash B[\sigma] \type }
    { \Delta \vdash \prod_{A[\sigma]}B[\sigma] \type }
  \end{mathpar}
\end{proof}

\section{Grothendieck Fibrations}
A fibration is a categorical structure that captures \emph{indexing} and \emph{substitution}.

\begin{defn}[Fiber category]
  Let $p : \iE \to \iB$ be a functor.
  For an object $I \in \iB$, the \emph{fiber} or \emph{fiber category} $E_{I} = p^{-1}(I)$ over $I$ is the category with
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \textbf{objects} & $X \in \iE$ with $pX = I$.\\
      \textbf{morphisms} & \emph{vertical} morphism.
                           That is, $f : X \to Y$ in $\iE$ for which $pf = \id_{I}$.
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Cartesian morphisms]
  Let $p : \iE \to \iB$ be a functor.
  A morphism $f : X \to Y$ in the total category $\iE$ is \emph{Cartesian} if for any $g : Z \to Y$ in $\iE$, any morphism $h : pZ \to pX$ in the base category such that $pf \circ h = pg$ has a unique lift $\htil : Z \to X$ in $\iE$ such that $f \circ \htil = g$.
  \input{img/fibration01}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Fibration]
  The functor $p : \iE \to \iB$ is a \emph{fibration} if for every $Y \in \iE$ and $u : I \to pY$, there is a Cartesian morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $\iE$ above $u$.
  Sometimes a fibration will be called a \emph{fibered category}.
  We often say that a Cartesian morphism $f : X \to Y$ above $u : I \to pY$ is a \emph{terminal} or \emph{Cartesian} lifting of $u$.
\end{defn}
A fibration $p : \iE \to \iB$ is discrete if every fiber category $\iE_{I}$ is discrete (a set).

\begin{thm}
  Let $p : \iE \to \iB$ be a fibration.
  Given a choice of Cartesian liftings, a map $u : I \to J$ in the base category $\iB$ determines a functor $u^{*} : \iE_{J} \to \iE_{I}$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  For $X \in \iE_{J}$, we have that $pX = J$.
  A choice of the Cartesian lifting of $u$ then determines a Cartesian map $\ubar(X) : \bullet \to X$ whose domain must be in $\iE_{I}$. This determines the action on objections.

  For each $f : X \to Y$ in $\iE_{J}$, since $f$ is a vertical morphism in $\iE$, the composite $f \circ \ubar(X) : u^{*}(X) \to Y$ is above $u$.
  The projection of these maps under $p$ determines a cospan that can be filled with the identity map.
  Cartesianness then guarantees a unique lifting $u^{*}(X) \to u^{*}(Y)$.

  Uniqueness guarantees functoriality.
\end{proof}

Given a fibration equipped with a cleavage, two composable morphisms $I \overset{u}{\to} J \overset{v}{\to} K$ in the base category $\iB$, the two resulting functors $u^{*} \circ v^{*}$ and $(v \circ u)^{*}$ are in general not equal-on-the-nose but naturally isomorphic.

The isomorphism arises because any two Cartesian lifts are isomorphic.
The identity map $\id : I \to I$ also gives rise to two isomorphic Cartesian lifts $\id : X \to X$ and $\id^{*}(X)$.

In certain cases, these isomorphisms are identities.

\begin{defn}[Cloven fibration]
  A \emph{cloven} fibration is a fibration equipped with a choice of Cartesian liftings.
  That is, it comes equipped with a \emph{cleavage}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Split fibration]
  A \emph{split} fibration is a cloven fibration for which the induced substitutions functors are such that the canonical natural transformations are identities.
  The cleavage involved is often called a \emph{splitting}.
\end{defn}

\section{Judgmental Theory}
\label{sec:judgmental-theory}
\begin{defn}
  A \emph{pre-judgmental theory} consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a category $\iC$ of contexts and substitutions with a terminal object $\diamond$;
  \item a set $\cJ$ of judgment classifiers $f : \dF \to \iC$ for the judgment $\dF$;
  \item a set $\cR$ of rules $\lambda : \dF \to \dG$;
  \item a set $\cP$ of policies induced by the rules and the judgments.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
A classifier is (op)substitutional if it is a Grothendieck (op)fibration.

\begin{defn}
  A \emph{judgmental theory} is a pre-judgmental theory such that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item rules and policies are closed under composition;
  \item the judgments are precisely the rules whose codomain is $\iC$;
  \item rules are policies are closed under finite limits, $\#$-liftings, and whiskering.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

Both the slice and the coslice over an object $\Gamma$ can be obtained by pulling back the universal discrete opfibration $\textsf{Set}_{*} \to \textsf{Set}$ along the (co)representable functor.
Thus, the coslice is a discrete Grothendieck opfibration, while the slice is a discrete Grothendieck fibration.

The fibered Yoneda Lemma then states that for any fibration $f : \dF \to \iC$, every element in the fiber of $f$ over $\Gamma$ determines a fibration $\iC/\Gamma \to \dF$.

\begin{defn}
  A (pre)judgmental theory has axioms if the initial fibration over $\iC$ is a judgment.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  A (pre)judgmental theory has substitution if
  \begin{itemize}
  \item all slices are judgments;
  \item for all fibrations $\dF \in \cR$ and for all $F \in f\inv(\Gamma)$, the corresponding arrow $F : \iC/\Gamma \to \dF$ is a rule.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
